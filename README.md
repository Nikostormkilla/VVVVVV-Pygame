This is exactly what it is. You play as Verdigris (but with the ATMOSFEAR level sprite) and thats all the changes.

Original repository is GDColon/VVVVVV-Pygame

Original sprites from ATMOSFEAR. (Custom assets from ATMOSFEAR by pixelator, ported to the Pygame version by me, just with slight changes to fit properly)
